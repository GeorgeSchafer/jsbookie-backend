# KwikGit

A few shell scripts to make updating single-developer projects easy. To add to your project, copy and past this into the terminal in your project folder:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/KwikGit.git
```

or to put into a filed named "sh" for "shell":

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/KwikGit.git sh
```
